Current state of software ?
current state = "IT WORKS", that it really, it is good that we have things to get the job done, like spreadsheets but then, accessing these is getting
harder and "pointy", seems that all those Research and Development centers at the big guys corps are just eating pop-corn.

Why ?
current desktop interfaces and environments suck, well, you can use all the eye candy but it is the same thing you will get and feel.
you feel controled in your little 21" screen , don't you want to DIVE IN ?

Crap ?
yes, this application is a big eye candy, i know, but i wanted to do it as fast as i could and avoid learning all complexities of X11, i mean, there are
people coding and maintaining X11 window managers that almost no one use, they wasted lots of time learning libx and it's tricks for fun (j/k, no knowledge is a waste of time, but waste of efforts is the correct expression)!

Why Qt ?
yes, i will not touch qt quick or qml, i just want plain old desktop Qt with signals and slots, and a drawing interface really, but then i chose Qt
because, i know Qt ( i did some basic stuff in qt, a calculator actually, ... wait, that was in C#, i also did a C++/Win32 calculator , gah ! ), Qt
has more features i might need later.

Others ?

there has been many claims and many trials to make a new GUI that would make interfaces more futuristic and easier, but they ignore the fact that
people won't throw their mice away or their keyboards, we all love 1968's technology that's why we use it ( nop, we do because it is everywhere,
systems adapted to it and we know no other alternative), i guess Microsoft or Apple won't admit anything like this unless they ar forced to, but what about the *Nix community ?


XCB or XLib ?
now XCB is getting more famous, however, xlib is widely used,it seems you write more lines in XCB, anyway, i only need basic stuff for now, move window
, resize window, kill window, love window.

The Point ?
the point is that, this might not be the next thing that everybody uses, but i hope it leads the way and wakes somebody up, problem is not in the hardware
, it is the software.

Double Skies ? (later)
yes, you can merge one sky into another through a network,
just like MazeWar in the 1973's Xerox Alto played over ethernet ( yes in 1973, just add acouple of decades and we are using the same old stupid architectures )

keyboard ?
yes, it's about time that keys mean what they say, ctrl means CONTROL and alt means ( well, alt, i have no idea ) !
Have fun.
